# MSPA To Go

MSPA To Go is an application server that serves pages from the MS Paint Adventures server
in a format that is digestible on desktop computers and mobile devices without any external
downloads.

MS Paint Adventures is the work of Andrew Hussie, and I am not associated with MS Paint Adventures,
What Pumpkin, VIZ Media, or the Homestuck Independent Creative Union. MSPA To Go is made out of love
for MSPA and a desire for it to be accessible to those using mobile devices.

## Hosting
To host MSPA To Go, you will need an Apache web server with support for at least PHP 8 (may be 8.1, I'm
not sure) with the cURL plugin.

## Reading offline
See [OFFLINE-MODE.md](OFFLINE-MODE.md).

## Docker
To run it in Docker, you'll just need to clone the repository and do:

```
docker build -t mspa --no-cache=true .
docker-compose up
```

And it should just work!
